# Build a Movie Trailer Website with Python

Use this server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL then generate a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.

## Quick Start

- You need [python](http://www.python.org) installed on your computer. 
- Update entertainment_center.py with your own fav movie info then run it. 
- A html file will be generated within the folder as a webpage for showing your favorite movies and movie trailiers.
